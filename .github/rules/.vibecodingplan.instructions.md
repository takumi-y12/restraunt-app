# VibeCoding Project Plan Instructions（強化版）

- When you are told "Create the VibeCoding project plan," refer to all documents in the docs/ folder (PRD.md, API設計.md, Database設計.md, 技術選定.md) and create a project plan in docs/VibeCoding計画書.md. The project plan should break down tasks into small, step-by-step units.
- The plan must include the following:
  1. An overview and objectives of the project (extracted from PRD.md)
  2. Implementation steps for required features (broken down into small tasks)
  3. Estimated completion time for each implementation step
  4. Details on technologies and libraries used (extracted from 技術選定.md)
  5. Development flow and testing strategy
  6. Milestones and deliverables, with clear acceptance criteria
  7. Task dependencies and parallelization opportunities
  8. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies for each phase
  9. Review/feedback points and responsible persons for each major deliverable
  10. Change management and versioning policy for the plan itself
- Each task should be divisible into small units that can be completed in about 1 to 2 hours. If a task is too large, subdivide it further.
- Ensure the order of tasks is clearly defined, taking into account dependencies and optimal team allocation.
- Use a table or checklist format for task breakdown, including: task name, description, assignee, estimated time, dependencies, status, and notes.
- All plans must be actionable, measurable, and traceable to project objectives.
- Include a summary Gantt chart or timeline if possible.
- All project plan creation and modifications must include the comment "Generated by Copilot".
