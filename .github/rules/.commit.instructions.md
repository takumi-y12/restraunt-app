# Commit Comment

- Write meaningful commit messages that explain the changes made.
- Avoid using the just writing the list of changes as commit messages.
- Use the prefix defined in the conventional commit style for commit messages.
- Use the following prefixes for commit messages:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes (no code change)
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring (no functional change)
  - `test:` for adding or updating tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- Use the following format for commit messages:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  <body>
  <footer>
  ```
