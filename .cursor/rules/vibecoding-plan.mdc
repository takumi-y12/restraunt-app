# VibeCoding Project Plan Rules

## Scope
- All files in the `vibecodig-plan/**` directory

## Basic Rules
- When instructed with "Create the VibeCoding project plan", refer to all documents in the `docs/` folder (PRD.md, API Design.md, Database Design.md, Technology Selection.md) and create a project plan in `docs/VibeCoding Plan.md`. The project plan should break down tasks into small, step-by-step units.

## Required Plan Components
1. Project overview and objectives (extracted from PRD.md)
2. Implementation steps for required features (broken down into small tasks)
3. Estimated completion time for each implementation step
4. Details on technologies and libraries used (extracted from Technology Selection.md)
5. Development flow and testing strategy
6. Milestones and deliverables, with clear acceptance criteria
7. Task dependencies and parallelization opportunities
8. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies for each phase
9. Review/feedback points and responsible persons for each major deliverable
10. Change management and versioning policy for the plan itself

## Task Granularity
- Each task should be divisible into small units that can be completed in about 1 to 2 hours. If a task is too large, subdivide it further.

## Task Order
- Ensure the order of tasks is clearly defined, taking into account dependencies and optimal team allocation.

## Task Documentation Format
- Use a table or checklist format for task breakdown, including:
  - Task name
  - Description
  - Assignee
  - Estimated time
  - Dependencies
  - Status
  - Notes

## Plan Quality Requirements
- All plans must be actionable, measurable, and traceable to project objectives.
- Include a summary Gantt chart or timeline if possible.

## Generation Source Attribution
- All project plan creation and modifications must include the comment "Generated by Cursor".
