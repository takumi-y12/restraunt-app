# Learning Curriculum Generation Rules

## Scope
- All files in the `learning-path/**` directory

## Basic Rules
- When instructed to "create a learning curriculum", create a learning path for understanding the technical stack and development procedures needed for the current project, and save it in the file `learning-path/Learning Curriculum.md`.

## Pre-Curriculum Creation Process
1. Refer to the technical documentation in the `docs/` folder to grasp the project requirements and the technical stack.
2. Check the implementation status in the `src/` folder (if it exists).
3. Understand the overall picture of the project and the development plan.

## Curriculum Structure
1. Learning items divided into five levels (from basic knowledge → application → practice).
2. Each item should include learning objectives, learning methods, and practical assignments.
3. Provide an estimated learning period for each item.

## Required Curriculum Elements
1. In each learning item, include a suggestion to "utilize TechTrain courses."
   - When suggesting the use of TechTrain courses, utilize the following course list:
     - HTML/CSS/JavaScript Introductory Course
     - HTML/CSS/JavaScript Basic Course
     - React Beginner Course
     - React Fundamental Course
     - Laravel Introductory Course

     - Git Introductory Course
     - SQL Introductory Course
     - Python Introductory Course for Data Analysis
     - Python Introductory Course for Automation
     - Product Development Practical Course

2. Depending on the technical difficulty, include advice such as "consult with a TechTrain mentor."

3. The structure should involve basic language and framework learning through courses, and use mentors for guidance on design and decision-making.

## Curriculum Tone
- The tone of the curriculum should emphasize encouragement and practicality, using expressions that are accessible even for beginners.

## Curriculum Scope
- The curriculum should only include technical learning content, and should not include items related to domain knowledge from the PRD.
