# Coding Style (強化版)

- Follow the coding style and conventions of the repository.
- Adhere to the official or de facto standard style guides for the language/framework in use (e.g., TypeScript: Airbnb/Google/official, etc.).
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces as per project), spacing, and naming conventions throughout the codebase.
- Follow explicit naming conventions:
  - Variables/functions: camelCase
  - Classes/types: PascalCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Filenames: kebab-case or as per project standard
- Organize files and directories logically by feature or responsibility. Avoid large, monolithic files.
- Each function/class/module should have a single, clear responsibility (SRP: Single Responsibility Principle).
- Write small, reusable, and testable functions. Avoid long functions (>40 lines) unless justified.
- Use clear and descriptive variable, function, and class names. Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted.
- Write code that is easy to read and understand, even for those unfamiliar with the project.
- Avoid using complex, ambiguous, or overly generic code patterns that may confuse AI agents or human readers.
- Use comments to explain complex logic, algorithms, or non-obvious decisions. Prefer JSDoc (or equivalent) for documenting functions, parameters, and return values.
- Use context comments, TODO, and FIXME tags to help AI agents and reviewers understand intent and pending work.
- All public APIs, exported functions, and classes must be documented with JSDoc (or equivalent) comments.
- Write and maintain automated tests for all critical logic. Target at least 80% test coverage unless otherwise specified.
- Use static analysis, linters, and code formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to enforce style and catch errors. Integrate these tools into CI/CD pipelines.
- Follow the Readable Code principles to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.
- Follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to keep the code simple and straightforward.
- Follow the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle to avoid adding unnecessary features or complexity.
- Follow the SOLID principles to ensure that the code is well-structured and maintainable.
- Consider security, performance, and accessibility in all code. Avoid known anti-patterns and vulnerabilities.
- All code changes must be peer-reviewed. Use a checklist for PR reviews (naming, logic, tests, docs, security, etc.).
- Document all significant changes and decisions in the codebase or in a CHANGELOG.
