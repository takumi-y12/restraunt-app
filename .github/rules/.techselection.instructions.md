# Technology Selection Guidelines (for VibeCoding)

- Always refer to the PRD (Product Requirements Document) and consider requirements, objectives, constraints, and developer experience (DX) when making technology choices.
- Prioritize technologies that are easy to learn, develop, and maintain, and that have strong community support and documentation ("VibeCoding-friendly").
- For web applications, unless otherwise specified, use React for the frontend and Next.js (full-stack) or BaaS solutions such as Firebase or Supabase for the backend.
- For mobile applications, use React Native or Flutter as the default choice.
- Game development is not supported and should be explicitly rejected as a project type.
- For other domains, select standard and widely adopted technologies (e.g., Node.js, Express, Python, FastAPI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, etc.).
- Clearly document the rationale for each technology choice, including alternatives considered and reasons for adoption or rejection.
- Always provide detailed setup instructions for the selected technologies, including recommended tools (editor, package manager, CI/CD, linter/formatter, etc.) and environment configuration. This is mandatory.
- Consider OSS licenses, commercial use restrictions, long-term viability, and maintainability in all decisions.
- Any changes or additions to technology selection must be documented with a change log and reviewed by relevant stakeholders.
- Evaluate security, scalability, and performance implications of each technology choice.
- Prefer solutions that enable rapid prototyping, easy onboarding, and minimize vendor lock-in.
- For cloud infrastructure, prefer managed services (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting) unless self-hosting is required by the PRD.
- Ensure accessibility and internationalization are considered if relevant to the project.
